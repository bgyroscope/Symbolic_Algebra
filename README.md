# Symbolic_Algebra

This is a package that preforms symbolic algebra manipulations using a dictionary. The key is an expression where as the coefficient is the value. For example, 3x^2y + 2 xy would be stored as dictionary { 'xxy': 3, 'xy': 2 } 


This class has the following methods: 
* init the expression --> expression( list of coefficients, list of expressions as strings ) 
* copy -->
